        Marie Otsuka is a designer and programmer working on and around methods for making: fonts, websites, tools, and books. She currently designs fonts and develops type-oriented tools at <a href="https://occupantfonts.com/">Occupant Fonts</a>, a Providence-based type foundry, while working with a range of organizations and artists as an independent web developer and graphic designer. By engaging with code as a design medium, Marie examines the embedded assumptions behind technology and explores a system’s capacity to respond to use. She teaches typography-focused web courses at the Rhode Island School of Design, and has presented on sustainable, context-driven websites at conferences globally. Her work has been featured on Walker Arts Center <em>The Gradient</em>, AIGA <em>Eye on Design</em>, <em>Fast Company</em>, <em>Communication Arts</em>, <em>Motherboard</em>, and <em>Hacker News</em>. She holds an MFA in Graphic Design from RISD and a BA in Interdisciplinary Studies from the University of Chicago.
